WaveCNV-segmenter

1. Prerequisites for Deployment

. Precompiled binaries for use with the free MATLAB MCR are available for 64-bit Linux only.  If
  you have Mac OSX or 32-bit Linux you will need to have the full version of MATLAB to compile
  from source. 

  (a) On 64-bit Linux you must have the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) version 8.0 (R2012b 64-bit)

  (b) Alternatively you can compile from source if you have have MATLAB versions 2010+

. If the MCR is not installed, Download and install the MCR installer from the MathWorks Web site:
      http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html

. If compiling from source, make sure that 'mcc' is in your executaion path, and that you have
  installed the MCR that came with your MATLAB version (not installed by default).

For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
Distribution to End Users in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.    

NOTE: You may need administrator rights to run the installer.


2. Installing WaveCNV-segmenter

. In a terminal window, change to the .../WaveCNV/segmenter/src/ directory.

. Configure the installation by running 'perl Build.PL'  on the command line.

. Answer questions as to whether you want to compile from source, and the location of the MATLAB
  MCR directory.

. After configuration run './Build install'. This will compile any needed code and put the
  segmenter.pl scipt in your .../WaveCNV/segmenter/bin/ directory. It is recommnded that you add
  this directory to your PATH environmental variable. 


3. To run WaveCNV

. Run .../WaveCNV/segmenter/bin/segmenter.pl with a standard pileup file generated from SAM/BAM
  files using the 'samtools mpileup' utility.

  Example: .../WaveCNV/segmenter/bin/segmenter.pl trio1.pileup

. Output will be a segment file containing CHR, START, and END position.  Use theis file as input
  to the WaveCNV-caller.

. Example data is included in the .../WaveCNV/segmenter/example_data/ directory.

. The current version of WaveCNV-segmenter is memory intensive, so at least 25Gb of RAM is recommended.
